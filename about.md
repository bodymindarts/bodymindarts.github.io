Hi, I'm Justin Carter, a Software Engineer and consultant based in Berlin, Germany.

I help clients deploy and maintain large scale distributed systems such as Cloud Foundry on their IaaS of choice, including building out CI/CD and other automation to minimize operational costs.

I am a core maintainer of the habitat.sh project and author of [Delmo](github.com/bodymindarts/delmo) a testing tool for containerized distributed system.

I work on a number of open source projects intended to augment usability of cloud native application runtimes such as self-serviced, highly available and backed up data services.

When I'm not busy with infrastructure or platform layer issues I love digging into complex domains and applying Domain Driven Design to solve complex business problems.

I have a diverse background, including professional experience as a magician, musician, performer and high stakes poker player.

I love the sight of vim in the morning...
