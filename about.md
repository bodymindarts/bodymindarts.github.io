Hi, I'm Justin Carter, a Software Engineer based in Germany currently doing full-stack Ruby on Rails development in an Unix, OSS environment.

I am passionate about building great software with like minded professionals.

I have a diverse background, including professional experience as a magician, musician, performer and high stakes poker player.

I love the sight of vim in the morning...
